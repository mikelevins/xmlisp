  <projectinfo project-title="Accretion 3D" description="Accretion is a process in which the size of something gradually increases by steady addition of smaller parts. In accretion particles move around until they encounter another stationary particle to connect to. As particles connect, large irregular shaped clusters are formed. In diffusion-limited aggregation, a particle undergoes Brownian motion until it makes contact with a free-floating cluster of particles. This is what underlies various natural phenomena, including crystalization." tags="enter comma-separated keywords" uuid="FA676CC1-4FB0-47FE-9314-7E5DA03D97A1" assignment-key=""/>
